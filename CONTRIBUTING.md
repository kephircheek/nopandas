## Documentation style

### Ignored `pydocstyles codes`

- `D105` - Missing docstring in magic method
Since intuitively realization of method will awaited, docstring is not required.
- `D407` - Missing dashed underline after section
In my opinion, statement is excess.
- `D212` - Multi-line docstring summary should start at the first line
In multi-line style starting from second line seems better.
- `D203` - 1 blank line required before class docstring
I do not see any reasons to do this.
